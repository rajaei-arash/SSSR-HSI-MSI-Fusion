# SSSR-HSI-MSI-Fusion
Code and Data for HSI-MSI-Fusion by a Fast Self-supervised Spectral Super-resolution


Note: 
The codes are prepared in "Keras TensorFlow" and are simply executed in the "Google colab" environment.


Directions:

This code fuses LRHSI and HRMSI of PaviaU dataset (or WashingtonDC dataset). (scale factor = 4)

- Run codes in sequence in Google Colab environment.

- To change the scale factor simply change the command (scale = 4) to (scale = 8) in the "Data Preparation for Fusion" section.

- The files needed to run the code should be copied to a folder called "SSSR" in the root. ('/content/drive/MyDrive/SSSR/PaviaU256x256.mat')
('/content/drive/MyDrive/SSSR/ikonos_SRF.mat')
